Jin Guangyao scoops back strands of her hair and twists them deftly into braids. "It can't be too scripted, or he won't believe it. Nie Mingjue values honesty and forthrightness, and despises liars and schemers."

Qin Su exhales sharply at the confirmation of what she'd already known, the potential danger that lies ahead. "So I need to seduce him without letting him know I'm seducing him?"

Nie Huaisang had been prepared to ignore his birthday, when Jin Zixuan accidentally reminds the entirety of Cloud Recesses' student population of the event. In short notice, Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng decide the occasion warrants an outing to Caiyi, Lan Xichen waves them off in pursuit of his own agenda, and Nie Huaisang isn't entirely certain what is happening. But he's having fun. 
Or: Nie Huaisang's birthday while studying in Gusu. Featuring one overturned boat, the most hideous fan ever, and one unexpected visitor.

During the Sunshot Campaign, Nie Huaisang wants to help despite his terrible sword skills. But there are other things he's good at, and nobody can say his mind is weak. But nobody has to know.After all, he wants to go back to his life of general uselessness after the war is over, and Nie Mingjue would never allow it if he saw a single sign of competence from him.But this has consequences that he didn't expect.

“Nie Huaisang?” he demands, stumbling down the dirt path towards him. “What- are you the one who took down my wards?!”He looks—awful. His eyes are sunken, his cheeks sallow. The robes he is wearing are nothing like the luxurious fabric he used to wear when he was still Yunmeng Jiang’s first disciple. Instead they are thread beard and worn, from a coarse fabric that looks irritating to the skin. There is a shakiness to his gait that Nie Huaisang has never seen from his friend, who always walked with such a presence as if to defy a world that has sentenced him to death. “Of course it was me!” he scolds. “You really should take better care and hide your talismans.”Wei Wuxian, rudely enough, ignores his (useful!) advice and instead looks at him like he’s mad. “What are you doing here?”“Betraying the gentry and siding with evil, duh,” Huaisang rolls his eyes. “Now, will you let me in? I’m hungry.”

The story doesn't end just because you tell it to.Wei Wuxian survives the fall, but visitors in the night teach him and Lan Wangji that the world keeps turning--even after it ends. It's not just grief for the dead that makes them realize their feelings for each other. It's the living and the immortal.In other words--an encounter with Lan Wangji's mother teaches Wei Wuxian a new path of cultivation.

“Why are you still here?” Xie Lian asked a small ghost flame. It was green with a purple tint, flickering in and out of existence, yet its core was oddly bright. The flame bobbed up and down slightly.“There are people I care about greatly, and I want them to stay safe,” the ghost flame said, and Xie Lian felt distantly that he’d heard those words before somewhere.Or: Jiang Yanli becomes a Calamity.

“Wei Ying,” says Lan Wangji hoarsely. He appears to struggle for words for a few moments, then simply lets his eyes slip shut. His face tilts unconsciously into his touch. “Wei Ying,” he says again. His voice around those two syllables might be the sweetest sound Wei Wuxian has ever heard. “Lan Zhan,” Wei Wuxian murmurs back. “Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan.” It feels like a prayer. ...or: Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji, and three thousand lanterns.

 Wei Wuxian’s heart broke when he realized that it was highly likely that no one had touched Lan Wangji much as a child. As turbulent as his childhood once was, Wei Wuxian remembered his father’s hand on his back, his sister’s lips on his forehead, wrestling with his brother and his friends, a lifetime of hugs and warmth. Lan Wangji had probably never experienced that. 
 Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji learn about the smaller, softer touches.

Lan Wangji shakes his head.
“In order to perform the Sacrificial Summoning Ritual, Mo Xuanyu had to piece together Wei Wuxian’s soul. Do you think... there’s a chance he missed a piece or two?”
On the way back from a visit to Yiling, Wei Wuxian falls ill. Lan Wangji, naturally, is terrified.

Wei Wuxian had everything planned out. He would slip away in the night, and no one would have to deal with him again. Madam Yu would be glad to see him gone, and Jiang Cheng would finally be treated like their son. The Lan sect wouldn't have to deal with his antics anymore. He wouldn't have to live with the burning hatred for himself curling in his stomach like a beast preparing to rip him apart from the inside out.He thought he had everything planned out, until a figure in white made him pause. Who was this Lan Wangji, and why was he so adamant about keeping Wei Wuxian alive?Now translated to Russian and Spanish!

It’s better this way, he told himself. Let them forget the useless First Jade. Let them forget my name. Let them forget me so that I can live out my days as I deserve— in silence, as payment for lives taken; forgotten, in payment for lies believed.

I am no one.


I am nothing.

The shadows reached out and curled around him.

We are waiting.

“I owe you for sparing my life.”

“What? What do you mean? I don’t think I know you?”

“Today you let a rabbit go,” the man answers, like that’s supposed to explain everything. He studies Wei Wuxian’s face to see if it clicks. “I was the rabbit. It is my other form.”

Wei Wuxian’s mouth opens and closes, not knowing what to say to that.  

“You called me little bunny. Then an enchantress.” The man has such a neutral expression for what he is saying. “You said you wanted to eat me. But you let me go.”
Wei Wuxian lives alone on top of a cold, snowy mountain. His only company is himself most days, until a beautiful stranger shows up at his door one night and claims he is indebted to him.

Wei Wuxian gets caught sneaking into Cloud Recesses. But since he can't tell the truth - that he's just here to deliver his teacher's most recent love letter to her soulmate who's stuck in a cave -  he tells a lie instead. He says that he's a Jiang disciple that had arrived late and so had snuck in through the gates. He hadn't expected the lie to work, sure that it would unravel as soon as they found a Jiang to verify it, but instead Jiang Yanli backs up his story, and even adds to it. Which is how he ends up masquerading as the first disciple of Lotus Pier while trying to figure out how to get out of Cloud Recesses without anyone discovering that he's the disciple of Baoshan Sanren.

Jiang Cheng knew that there were many more important things he could be doing. Demons to kill, ghosts to lay to rest.

Five years after Wei Wuxian’s death, Nie Huaisang hosts the latest cultivation conference. All goes well until the leader of the Jin Sect, Jin Guangyao, is murdered.

On the roof of their little shrine, words were engraved: what matters is you, and not the state of you.

Home is Cloud Recesses now, and that's a thing Wei Wuxian is still getting used to. He still feels like a guest here, most days, though Lan Wangji has done everything to make him feel at home. He stands out like a sore thumb amongst the serene disciples and flowing white fabric.

Cloud Recesses has been home to Lan Wangji and Sizhui for years. It is their home, where they've built their family.
  The thought warms Wei Wuxian even as it sits a little ill with him. He's an intruder here, in their homes, in their lives, the same way he had been in Lotus Pier.

Poe wakes to yet another skull-crushing headache, alone, slumped over in a corner of the cold cell. He doesn’t really hope for a rescue— at least, not in his rational mind. He’s starting to forget what real human faces look like. He’s forgetting a lot of things, honestly. What are they doing to him? What is he forgetting?He is trapped in the belly of the sarlacc, but he’s not the one who’s dying.///“General Organa.” Finn looks her dead in the eye. “I have to go rescue him. He is my commander, my comrade, and my friend. To leave him in the hands of the First Order would be cruel and inhumane. Even if—” Finn gulps. “Even if he has actually turned, he deserves a fair trial and—and execution.”

When it comes to kicking ass and taking names, there's no group of bounty hunters in the galaxy that do it better than the three of them. Kylo Ren, Hux, and Rey might have been pulled together by nothing more than luck, but somehow they'd ended up as the most successful and infamous team in their field. So far, there had never been a hit too difficult, a smuggling load too big, or a bit of intel too secure for them to tackle. Sure, things don't always go exactly according to plan, but if there's one thing Kylo's learned about smuggling and bounty hunting, it's that there's no need to be a perfectionist as long as the jobs are steady and the credits keep rolling in.

„Viktor...“ he said quietly, almost as if he was talking to himself, the words mumbled into the crook of his neck. „Please tell me, um… have you-?“ he stammered, making Viktor chuckle. He firmly gripped Yuuri‘s wrists and slowly dragged them further down to his ass. As Yuuri squeezed, Viktor jumped into his hug and bit his lip to suppress a moan as the vibrator was pushed further inside and dangerously grazed his prostate.One thing that would never change was that the prize for enduring something unpleasant would always outweigh the pain, that the effort he put into something would always be rewarded in the future. And well, Viktor was greedy and used to pushing himself to his limits.- - - - -Yuuri and Viktor join the Mile High Club

The problem is, the only thing that was keeping Hux from finding Ren infuriatingly attractive was his childishness. Which is now, apparently, gone. Kylo Ren grew up at age thirty five and in a span of seven months. It’s kriffing ridiculous. It shouldn’t be possible, but the evidence is right there.(Kylo suddenly becomes effortlessly dominant and Hux has trouble sleeping because of it.)

In time Kylo follows to explain himself and try to heal the wounds between them. Hux doesn't know if he can trust Kylo again after all he's done, even if his heart wants to.

Getting stuck in Kaedwen in winter had never been on Jaskier's plan. It's cold, they don't appreciate his music and nobody likes their national beverage anyway. The only redeeming thing Kaedwen has is Kaer Morhen, so Jaskier does what any reasonable bard would do in this situation: he decides to charm his way into Kaer Morhen to hibernate with Geralt and the other witchers. If nothing it will be an experience no human has ever had, fuel for songs and poems for years to come, while finally teaching him a thing or two about witchers he's just dying to know.Curiosity tended to kill the cat, but Jasker had always seen himself as more of a bird anyway.

“See?” Jaskier teased, “I told you I would kiss it better.” He leaned upwards, pressing another chaste kiss to Geralt’s temple. “One more for good luck.” Geralt gave him a look that said he found Jaskier unspeakably odd but was too tired to say so. Jaskier (who was used to this look) simply patted his knee, rolled over, and promptly fell asleep.As he fell asleep, Jaskier failed to notice that the wound seemed to shrink further, quickly reduced to nothing more than a thin white scar. He also failed to see Geralt raise a hand to his head, slowly tracing the scar and staring, dumbfounded, at Jaskier. The room was quiet for the night, save for a single, soft “Fuck.”(or: Jaskier has healing powers, and also feelings. Geralt doesn't really understand either.)

The people of Lettenhove listen to every song that Jaskier writes. He is their viscount, after all. The songs speak of witchers as heroes, as saviors, and the people believe them. When Eskel stumbles on the town in a desperate state, he discovers an unexpected safe haven in Jaskier's home and sets off a chain of events that quickly spirals into something powerful. Something the poets call destiny. The destiny of a manor and its people. Because after all these years, after all the hatred and the scorn, the witchers of Kaer Morhen have found a place to call home. Heavy on the Jaskier/all the witchers friendship, but he and Geralt are in an established romantic relationship. Works as a standalone!

Jaskier knows that, for the most part, he’s useless. A burden. He’s pretty and he sings well, but he doesn't have much more to offer Geralt on his Path.  Medicine, though, is a decidedly useful skill. It’s one that does not require strength or fighting ability- just a sharp mind and hours of study. And oh, how Jaskier has studied.If only Vesemir would stop underestimating him.Part of a series, technically, but can absolutely be read as a standalone.

Sometimes, the nights on the road just get too lonely – especially for someone like Jaskier, who is so deeply accustomed to the bustle and hustle of overcrowded cities. The Witcher would provide him with all the privacy he truly needs during these trying times, but his heightened senses deny him every opportunity to do so. Hence why he ends up at the other side of their camp, pretending he cannot hear how the man of his wettest dreams tends to his own lust…

From the moment Jaskier approached his table, he's always smelled thick and heady with arousal-- part of being eighteen, Geralt supposed. He used to stay in a dark corner of a sad tavern and drink to distract himself while the Jaskier finished his songs, plopped down at the table across from him and pouted, then turned his most lovelorn look at a pretty maid. Geralt drank deep as Jaskier whispered sweet nothings and soft, dark promises to her, felt the heat grow in the room as the blush rose in them both and they fumbled away. By the time he could hear Jaskier coming-- panting, hot and fast-- he usually found the shattered remains of his tankard in his fist. Geralt can hear all of Jaskier's amorous encounters... and finds he can't bring himself to stay out of earshot.

The witchers of Kaer Morhen have never been comfortable with gentle touches. It just isn't who they are. But when Geralt arrives to spend the winter with his brothers looking more relaxed than any of them have felt in years, all due to the affection of a human bard, Lambert and Eskel grow curious. They wonder what it would be like to be touched or held without fear. When Lambert runs into Jaskier in a small town in Redania, it's the safest he's felt in years. He and his brothers need touch and kindness more than they're willing to admit, and all Jaskier wants it to help , if only the witchers would let him. Geralt and Jaskier are together, all the other relationships are platonic with a good helping of touch-starvation on the side.

It had been a plan 800 years in the making.
Meticulous detail had been given to the most minor of aspects, everything carefully railroaded to the point that their current collision was inevitable. The interference of Crimson Rain Sought Flower was annoying, but he had been easily banished from the Kiln. A tiny blip in the wider scheme of things, nothing in the face of Jun Wu’s planning. Or rather, Bai Wuxiang currently.
Now, it was just him and his disciple.
XianLe was furious at him of course, hackles visibly raised at him from across the cavern, but that was fine. That strong rebellious spirit was all part of the charm.
Everything was right where he wanted it. That was all that mattered.

Jun Wu makes a big mistake. Xie Lian becomes something new.

Carefully, almost in loving reverence, Hua Cheng gathered Xie Lian's foot and proceeded to bandage it expertly. Then, he examined his legs and arms for any cut or bruise – cleaning the cuts, pressing his lips on each bruise.
Xie Lian gasped, eyes wide, the trembling in his body increasing ten folds. His burning cheeks were turning to lava, frying his brain in the process. He couldn't understand what was happening. Why was Hua Cheng acting this way? It didn't make any sense!
 "S-San Lang, ah!?"
After getting rid of a spirit in a neighboring village, Xie Lian attempts to return home fast enough, but ends up injuring himself along the way. He doesn't dare call Hua Cheng who went back to Ghost City, knowing he is busy. But maybe that's a mistake.Maybe, just maybe, there's a chance the Ghost King actually wants to help him out.

“There’s going to be a celebration today,” San Lang says, his voice still low with sleep. He waits until Xie Lian’s eyes have blinked all the way open to start speaking, the back of Xie Lian’s hand still pressed to his mouth. 
“Is there?” Xie Lian asks, a little lazy in his still sleepy state. He curls his fingers around San Lang’s, holding onto his hand in return. His dark hair is wild and disorderly around his face, the way it usually is upon waking, save for the single tidy braid that ends in a round coral bead. San Lang nods, flipping Xie Lian’s hand over to kiss the lines of his palm, followed by the inside of his wrist.
He lays his head back for a moment, letting San Lang’s mouth wander up the inside of his arm, kissing the skin that Xie Lian’s inner robes leave exposed. It takes a moment of thought before Xie Lian comes up with the answer, suppressing a laugh when San Lang’s mouth lingers at the sensitive crease of his arm.
“Shangyuan Festival?” He asks, rolling his head to the side so he can take in San Lang once again. He nods, releasing Xie Lian’s arms to cup a hand around his cheek. Xie Lian presses his face into San Lang’s cool hand. “Are we celebrating as well?”

“I’ll be done in just a moment, sweet boy,” Xie Lian says. He’s elbow-deep in their sink, warm water sliding between his fingers as he washes their dishes. Iridescent suds, sharp with the scent of bergamot, lather his skin. “Thank you for being so patient.”
Hua Cheng hums softly in response. He hasn’t spoken since dinner: he’s still so far under it makes Xie Lian’s heart throb. After all, it isn’t often that Hua Cheng allows himself to indulge this headspace for long stretches of time, which makes today particularly unusual—and particularly important.

Xie Lian scoops Hong-er up with him, but to his surprise the little body in his arms suddenly tenses. Humming softly, he gives Hong-er a bounce to encourage him to relax his weight; when this doesn’t work like it usually does, his brow furrows. “Hong-er?”
Hong-er squirms again, and so Xie Lian sets him down. Almost immediately, he grabs Xie Lian’s hand and tugs him back towards the desk. “We gotta stay here,” he explains, scrambling under it.
“Oh?” Xie Lian arches an eyebrow curiously, but allows himself to be shepherded under the desk, too. “How come?”
“We gotta hide from the monsters,” Hong-er explains, holding a finger up to his lips. “Shh, gege. They can hear us.”
Hua Cheng regresses to Hong Hong-er and decides to play a game of hide and seek with his very favorite gege. Unfortunately, they meet a few monsters along the way.

“Gege, where are you?” he asked. His heart would be thumping in his chest if it could.“San Lang…” was the only answer he got. 
After being busy in Ghost City for a few days, Hua Cheng is excited to return to Puqi shrine to be by his gege's side again. When he arrives, however, he has the unpleasant surprise of Xie Lian being away. He waits, and waits, until he's too worried and goes to look for him. When he finds him, it's far worse than he thought.

A nameless ghost once exited the kiln of Mount Tonglu, becoming a supreme. His name became Hua Cheng, and he was then called Crimson Rain Sought Flower.A ghost whose name had been his own death sentence, He Xuan, had also exited the kiln, becoming Black Water Submerging Boats. Those names were known and feared by all the three realms, and they had been forged after years of suffering inside of a mountain.However, when a new supreme was born from the kiln, after having spent only one year inside of it, he needed no name to accompany his exit. Everyone already knew his name, so it was useless to give him a new one.The name of the person was Xie Lian, and he was known for being a scrap-picking god. No one, in all the three realms, expected him to fall so low. Or: after Xie Lian is locked in Mount Tonglu with Bai WuXiang, he is deceived and dies, becoming a supreme. It's not as angsty as it sounds, I swear.

Hua Cheng puts a finger to his temple thoughtfully. He asks, "Who wants to tell me what the deal is with all these damn petals?"

The communication array goes completely silent, a feat almost in itself. Hua Cheng muses silently that gods can, apparently, shut the fuck up—they just choose not to. How convenient. 

It takes a moment before Ling Wen manages to speak up. "Your Highness," she says carefully, "what did you say just now?"

"These white petals? There's got to be a hundred of them. The man just—oh yeah, there was a man—exploded into them. What's up with that?"

There's a long stretch of silence where it feels like all of Heaven is holding its breath.

Finally, Ling Wen responds. Her voice is clipped as she asks, "What do you know about the Four Calamities? Specifically, White Flower Mourns Massacre?"
Alternatively: the one where Hua Cheng is a martial god, Xie Lian is a calamity, and nobody is at all what they seem.

It's Hua Cheng's birthday, and Xie Lian is stuck on what gift to give him. A chance encounter in the market while he's trying to figure it out will give him all the answers he needs to give his husband the best birthday he could ever dream of.


“So you won’t tell me what you’ve been up to, then?”


Xie Lian laughs, and turns to kiss Hua Cheng’s jaw. “You’ll find out sooner rather than later. And that’s all I’m going to give you.”


Hua Cheng spends the rest of the day pretending to pout and sulk, lamenting about how his husband is keeping secrets and he can’t trust anyone anymore, until Xie Lian makes it up to him as they’re preparing for bed that night. The smugness radiates from him in waves as Xie Lian curls in close, still overheated and breathless, and earns him a gentle smack on his naked chest.

The lips on his pause. “…It’s curious, how fate elongated our story to such an extent. I wouldn’t be able to show gege how to want if he hadn’t shown me first.”

Hua Cheng unconsciously cranes up, wanting to kiss him. Gege opens his eyes and leans down to kiss him softly, chaste except for a tug of teeth at the end. He pulls back with a soft sigh and takes his fingers out to place a warm, comforting hand on Hua Cheng's thigh. Hua Cheng isn't fooled by this display into thinking there will be any mercy.

“I,” Xie Lian says. He’s breathless, dazed. Hua Cheng loves him like this—loves him in all ways, all the time, but certainly like this. However, there’s something else beneath Xie Lian’s watery eyes and ragged breaths. He swallows thickly, then one of his hands is moving along Hua Cheng’s arm to his chest. His fingers brush lightly over the skin there, skimming just above Hua Cheng’s right nipple, and his eye flutters closed at the sensation.
And then, just as quickly as the feeling came, it disappears. He opens his eye, expecting to see Xie Lian drawing his hand away.
Instead, Xie Lian’s hand is splayed across the left side of his chest. Between his pointer and middle fingers is the hole that never went away.
“It’s grown,” Xie Lian says. “It’s still growing.”
“Oh,” Hua Cheng says, because he doesn’t know what else to say. Of course, he already knows that the hole has grown. He’d spent an hour yesterday, while Xie Lian was peacefully dozing in his lap, trying to heal it.
The Ghost King's body begins to rot. Xie Lian tries his best to figure out why.

"The Lords of Elfland are true lords, the only true lords, the kind that do not exist on this earth: their lordship is the outward sign or symbol of real inward greatness.”  Ursula K. Le Guin. Harry ends up accidentally bonding himself as Lord to several Slytherins after the Battle of Hogwarts, including Snape and Draco Malfoy.

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry goes into the Forbidden Forest to surrender his life to Voldemort. When the Dark Lord tries to kill him, they both get knocked unconscious. Harry wakes up first and, owing to Dumbledore’s Pensieve trips showing Harry Tom Riddle’s miserable childhood, Harry instead decides to Apparate away and deliver Voldemort to the Ministry to be imprisoned, like Dumbledore did with Grindelwald. The Ministry, however, chooses to execute the Dark Lord. Twelve years later, Harry is suffering. His magic is unhinged and he doesn’t feel right, but when he stumbles upon a horrific scene in a cell at the Ministry, suddenly he comes back to himself. Voldemort is being tortured by the Ministry of Magic and no one but his three guards and the Minister knows about his existence. They are keeping his life a secret because they are unable to kill him and his power is such that they know he will not be able to be contained forever. Harry is left struggling with the many shifting ways to do the right thing and the changing question of: right thing by whom?

Playing with Dark Magic was like playing with fire, sooner or later a person got burned. Tom can’t help himself, he likes the way that the matches feel in his hands. He likes the way the smoke twirls upward, the heat, the intensity. It makes him feel alive, with its promise of power and ability to wipe the slate clean. Cleanse all the things that have ever wronged him, comfort him with the knowledge what he has gained will never be taken from him. Except his wonderful fire has finally scorched his hand and sent him to an unknown future, where it's in ruin, and the person that he thought would never betray him... has become nothing but a snake-faced monster. Harry gets more than he bargained for when the Order accidentally rescues Tom Riddle on a raid. He looks just like he has stepped out of the diary and into 1998. The smug egotistical bastard... just might be the end of him….And well... Harry just might be okay with that...

He says, “What’s your name?”There’s a very long pause. He can hear the other man deciding whether to lie. But there is no purpose to it, except for bitterness, and the answer is uttered cold and shortly. “Nicolò.”(Or: The inevitable backstory.)

General Hux had always been a man of calculation as much as ambition. His climb to the top of the First Order was a carefully orchestrated and executed series of plans, as was his quest to ultimately claim the throne of the galaxy. For years only one obstacle stood in his way: Supreme Leader Snoke and the unknown factor of the Force. That was, until Snoke dropped Kylo Ren, his blood-soaked attack dog, right into Hux’s lap. Blindly loyal and incredibly powerful, Ren was the perfect tool for Hux to utilize and finally take his empire. However, while the steps to subtly shift Ren’s loyalty from Snoke to himself were clear and precise, Kylo Ren was nothing if not an unknown, volatile variable, and General Hux soon found himself caught between his ruthlessness and his desires.

Loyalty is something General Armitage Hux expects from his military, and those he deems worthy of close confidence. He has it all with the command of the First Order’s military, everything else to look forward to, with nothing but the Resistance in his way. That is, until Supreme Leader Snoke places Kylo Ren on the Finalizer, and Hux’s well ordered world turns upside down. Between learning to deal with a volatile Knight of Ren- and the growing tension between them- Hux also learns he’s not the only one with personal agendas. His own loyalty to his very beliefs and command are put to the test, when those most loyal to him become targets of misfortune, and he has to decide just how firm a grip he wants to keep on the First Order as its most powerful officer, all while dealing with a powerful, but badly damaged Master of the Knights of Ren.

Sure, Palpatine had betrayed him to a extent that he was only beginning to understand, there were three murdered Jedi in the Chancellor's office, he didn't know if Padmé was going to be alright, and it was completely possible that he was going to end up as a bloody smear across the windshield of a speeder, but the fact remained that he and Obi-Wan had just spent the last ten minutes shrieking at one another like a pair of younglings to such a degree that they forgot about the Sith Lord in the room.

Colonel Kix began scheduling transports to go out across the galaxy, and the first few to return reunited several families with their stormtroopers quite happily and without incident. Suralinda Javos had returned to cover the events, and popular opinion continued to be wildly in favor of what the Republic was doing for the ex-stormtroopers.  People began, actually, to consider the war already won, which was its own problem. Taxpayers wanted to dump all their money into the SRTF—which no one was complaining about—but got stingy with military spending, leaving the New Republic Navy to find creative—though, now, more legal than they would once have been—solutions to their funding difficulties.“The First Order relies on our complacency,” Poe had told Javos in an interview that barely got them the votes to pass their skeleton budget. “I’m against military spending as much as the next person, but as long as we have half a dozen star destroyers unaccounted for, we have to assume the First Order is still out there, waiting until we disarm to strike again.”“Will we ever get to disarm, then?” Javos had asked him, suddenly the cutting reporter again.“Force, I hope so,” Poe had said.

Luke believes Rey is a new Chosen One. With her mysterious origin and her strength in the Force, it makes a disturbing amount of sense. Luke doesn't want to train a Chosen One, especially not after the night Kylo Ren fell to the Dark Side and Luke was tempted. But not everything is as it seems...not even Luke's memories.

When Kylo Ren barges into Hux's quarters looking for a fight, he finds that Hux already has company--there's a pair of Stormtroopers in there with him. He's curious enough to investigate further, but he finds more than he bargained for: Hux spread out between them on his bed, the very picture of decadence. It's the hottest thing he's ever seen, and he can't help but stay to watch, hiding in the shadows. But the longer he watches, the more jealous he becomes...

Hux didn’t have time to gasp as he was abruptly pulled into a dark corridor, his back hitting the Durasteel wall behind him hard enough to make him grunt in pain. Fear took over his logical thinking, memories of his enemies swearing to have Hux killed flashed across his mind as he tried to focus on his surroundings.

AU/canon divergent COMPLETED STORY. It was a game, Aizen told himself, to see if could pull Gin into his sphere of influence, and more importantly into his bed. Then cast him aside when he got bored. But the reality was very different, and he was just deluding himself. Gin, however, decides to play along with his game. And it becomes a battle of wits to see who falls first. Even if it's completely unnecessary. Eventual smut. Some lighthearted silliness fuelled by caffeine and late night writing sessions. AU in which Gin is a lot older than he is in bleach canon. Part of the Heirverse series but can be read independenty.

The funny thing about dying a few times, Aizen, is that you learn things you could otherwise never fathom.”“I can’t say I have ever had the experience,” Aizen said sarcastically. “I have no wish to grant you the experience either,” Ichigo intoned patiently.“Oh? But you wish to put a stop to me do you not?” He asked in feigned curiosity. “How do you propose to do so without killing me? Because I can assure you, I will not hesitate to wipe you from existence if you continue to get in my way, boy.” He finished with a narrowing of his eyes.“I don’t need to kill you Aizen, I need to kill who you are.

But I do not know you,” gold eyes hardened, “to truly know a man like you, one must cross blades. Only then will our souls truly reach each other.”

But when he gets involved in a skirmish against the mountain oni and saves Kuchiki Rukia, a tengu and the younger sister of the leader of the Tengu Clan, Renji finds himself persuaded to assist the other youkai clans to fight against the mountain oni on Hyakki Yagyo to stop them from destroying all of Spirit Society.Before he can ally himself with them, however, the youkai must work to fully regain his trust. But even he doesn't expect Kuchiki Byakuya, the aloof leader of the Tengu Clan, to be the one putting in the most effort. And neither do both of them expect to become so drawn to each other.But will Renji allow himself to let Byakuya in despite the ghosts of the past? And can he overcome those ghosts in time to help save Spirit Society from the oni?

The Alliance attempts to bring together the remaining Marleyan survivors and Paradisian political exiles from the Yeagerist purges by arranging a marriage between the last Paradis Royal and the Marleyan War Chief. Everything goes wrong.There are no happy endings because nothing ends. This story is canon up to the Rumbling, but the Alliance stops the Rumbling differently: Armin gets Reiner to ingest Eren's spinal fluid, Eren breaks free of Ymir(Níðhöggr)'s control with Reiner and crystallizes to stop Mikasa from killing him to fulfill Ymir's snuff fantasy. He remains near death in paths, working to change the Titan Curse.I wrote this to take the sting out of the ending, not replace it, and give Eren and Reiner's character arcs conclusions that make sense to me. These two men were responsible for tremendous suffering and death, I wanted to see them contend with that, do penance and atone by building something from it like actual men. Not end with 'ha ha, they're pathetic' perv jokes thus trivializing both the characters and the harm they've done.As always, YMMV.Warning: There's a lot of mythological shenanigans in the last few chapters. Some people may find this off-putting.

After being blamed for the death of his alpha twin brother at the age of ten, omega Ciel Phantomhive is surrendered by his parents to a specialty orphanage that caters to the lecherous whims of lonely alphas. Now a young man, Ciel is determined to escape the orphanage he has called home for the last eight years to make a life for himself without relying on those he has come to despise. But in a world where alpha is king, determination is not always enough. Sometimes, a demon must be summoned. And a soul might not be what he requires as payment.

Until a ghost from the past turns their world upside down and leaves them once more fighting for their lives...

Alex Rider's life has collapsed around him, after failing all of his GCSEs and getting kicked out of school, he's stuck working for MI6, a series of bad missions leave him in a poor mental place and he attempts to take his own life. The last thing he does is send a postcard to Wolf asking him to make arrangements for his funeral.  This is a story, very heavily inspired by amitai's story on fanfiction(.)net called attempt. It follows some of the same plot beats as that original fanfiction but this is my own take on that original idea. As is evident, this story will deal with heavy plot elements including suicide attempts and this is generally a rather unhappy story - though it will end on a positive note.

Not for him the marble and gold, hookers and blow lifestyle of your average career criminal. All Yassen Gregorovich wanted to do after hard week assassinating, was to order a takeaway, open a nice bottle of wine and spend some quality time with his favourite person in the whole wide world.

Until finally, his shouts reach his Hollow in the form of an echo.

No, listen--” he gave 74 a glare when it looked like his brother wanted to interrupt again. “I’ve heard the stories, and they’re always the same. The tubies all know what he looks like. They all know he’s a jetii, before anyone ever told them what a jetii was. You know how the longnecks keep batches of tubies separate.
