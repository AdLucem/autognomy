# startup

A set of haskell-turtle scripts to be run to initialize a fresh Ubuntu-Gnome account with everything needed.

### Set up a fresh PC

Once you have a new PC running Ubuntu (18.04+) and Gnome, you probably want to set it up. Install your programming languages, frequently-used programs, make it look pretty, install gnome shell extensions like Caffeine, etc..

`startup` does (most of) that for you.

### Set up a new account on an existing PC

If you want to add a new account to a PC that's already running linux, with all the bells and whistles and frills, `startup` will also do that for you.
